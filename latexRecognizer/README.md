## Latex Symbol Recognizer
This example show how to predict latex symbols via a Convolutional Neural Network. This example loads a converted tensorflow-keras model for predictions. This [dataset](https://github.com/MartinThoma/HASY) used to train the ConvNet. The accuracy of the python keras model is 81% and there is room to improve. The colab notebook is available [here](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1bHlH4bGh5uUg4W20VGD7D-1bNwjLT7BX).
